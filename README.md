# UVSimGUI
Software Engineering Project for UVU (GUI)

## Collaborators:
Nathan Hanzel, Connor Creer, David Riggs, and Tad Huntsman

## Starting the Program
Open up the project in Visual Studio 2017, and click on the "Local Windows Debugger" button to start the program.

You will see the terminal pop up first, but don't worry, the GUI will shortly follow it.

## Inputting the script
When you are inputting your script, you are required to put in 4 letter words with a plus prepended to the word (+4000)

(Make sure that there isn't a newline character at the end of the input or else the compiler won't run)

## Inputting test data
If your program requires you to give input, there is a textbox right above the main memory window.

Once you put in the input, you must press SUBMIT, then RUN again. If you only press submit, the program will wait for you to start the program up again.
